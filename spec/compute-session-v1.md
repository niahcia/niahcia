# ComputeSessionV1

Status: **CANDIDATE / pre-alpha sticky bounded worker session**

## Purpose

`ComputeSessionV1` defines the bounded period during which a wallet/client keeps using one selected compute worker for a sequence of related Jobs.

The objective is to preserve low latency, model warmth, and simple single-worker payment-channel accounting without creating permanent worker affinity or winner-take-all scheduling.

The central rule is:

> worker selection may be sticky for efficiency, but every session is bounded and replaceable.

## Candidate canonical fields

```text
ComputeSessionV1
- schema_version
- session_id
- requester_identity
- worker_id
- operator_id
- model_id
- execution_profile_id
- verification_policy_id
- compute_channel_id
- started_height
- expiry_height
- max_jobs
- max_total_spend
- max_idle_blocks
- sequence
- status
```

Exact policy constants remain candidate.

## Session establishment

A session begins only after a worker has been selected from an eligible candidate set under the applicable scheduling policy. For ordinary paid compute, Worker Selection V1 permits the wallet/client to perform this selection locally from signed, expiring advertisements; chain consensus does not choose the worker.

The selected worker MUST satisfy the Job/session requirements at establishment, including:

- model support;
- ExecutionProfile support;
- service status;
- current advertisement validity;
- price/budget ceiling;
- required verification capability;
- bond/accountability requirements where applicable.

The session does not grant the worker chain-consensus authority or ownership of the wallet, Agent, conversation, or memory.

## Sticky execution

Jobs in the same session may continue using the selected worker while all bounds remain valid.

This is preferred over selecting a new worker for every chat prompt because it can:

- keep the model loaded/hot;
- reduce repeated discovery and handshake latency;
- amortize channel setup;
- preserve streaming responsiveness;
- simplify cumulative payment receipts.

Sticky execution MUST NOT imply permanent exclusivity.

## Mandatory bounds

A session MUST be bounded by at least:

- `expiry_height`;
- `max_jobs`;
- `max_total_spend`;
- `max_idle_blocks`;
- ComputeChannel expiry;
- current worker advertisement validity.

The effective session end is the earliest applicable bound.

## Reselection triggers

The wallet/client MUST end or suspend the session and re-run worker selection when the selected worker becomes ineligible or unusable.

Examples include:

- worker advertisement expires;
- worker goes offline;
- execution deadline is missed;
- model/profile support changes;
- price exceeds authorized policy;
- compute channel expires or is exhausted;
- worker enters DRAINING/SUSPENDED/EXITED;
- verification policy requires a new independent participant;
- operator-diversity policy would be violated;
- repeated objectively measurable service failures exceed policy thresholds.

A poor or undesirable LLM answer alone is not proof of protocol misbehavior and does not justify slashing.

## Voluntary rotation

A wallet MAY rotate workers before a mandatory trigger.

Scheduling policy may impose a maximum session age or job count to ensure that long-lived interactive use does not permanently concentrate demand on one worker/operator.

V1 SHOULD prefer bounded periodic reselection rather than random worker changes on every prompt.

## Suggested initial development policy

For early devnet testing, implementations may begin with a simple development profile such as:

```text
max_jobs       = 100
max_session    = 120 blocks
max_idle       = 20 blocks
```

These values are development defaults only and are not production consensus constants.

The protocol should measure:

- cold-start vs warm latency;
- worker failure/reselection time;
- selection distribution across operators;
- session length distribution;
- channel utilization;
- user-visible interruption rate.

Production values should be informed by those measurements.

## Privacy

A ComputeSession binds a sequence of Jobs together from the selected worker's perspective.

Therefore longer sessions improve performance/payment efficiency but increase linkability between prompts handled by that worker.

Wallets SHOULD permit privacy-sensitive users or policies to request shorter sessions or immediate reselection.

Changing workers does not require moving durable conversation state because V1 Agent/chat memory remains wallet/client-local.

## Verification interaction

The primary ComputeSession binds only the primary worker.

Independent verifiers required by a VerificationPolicy MUST be selected separately under the policy's diversity rules. A verifier controlled by the same operator does not satisfy an operator-independence requirement merely because it has a different worker ID.

## Payment interaction

A V1 ComputeSession SHOULD reference one worker-bound `ComputeChannelV1`.

When the session ends, the channel may be settled/closed or kept only if its policy explicitly permits reuse with the same bound worker and scope.

A new worker requires a new worker-bound ComputeChannel.

## Failure continuity

If a worker fails:

```text
wallet-local conversation/memory
      |
      +-- end/suspend old ComputeSession
      +-- preserve Job/result history locally
      +-- select replacement worker
      +-- open new worker-bound channel if needed
      +-- send only required context
      +-- continue
```

No Agent-state migration between workers is required.

## Invariants

1. One ComputeSession has one primary worker/operator.
2. Sessions are bounded and expire.
3. Worker stickiness grants no consensus authority.
4. Durable user memory is not owned by the session worker.
5. Reselection is possible without storage-node participation.
6. A new worker requires fresh eligibility evaluation.
7. Independent verification follows VerificationPolicy diversity rules, not session affinity.
8. Session continuation cannot exceed payment authorization/channel bounds.
9. Session identity may be pseudonymous and need not reveal the durable funding account.
10. Production rotation constants are policy parameters, not silently hard-coded consensus values.

## First milestone

The first implementation should prove:

1. select one eligible worker;
2. establish one ComputeSession;
3. open/bind one ComputeChannel;
4. execute several Jobs while the model remains warm;
5. accumulate usage receipts;
6. simulate worker loss;
7. reselect a different worker;
8. continue from wallet-local context;
9. settle the original channel;
10. confirm no conversation/storage migration was required.


## Transport interaction

A ComputeSession SHOULD establish one authenticated AI Transport V1 session with the selected primary worker.

Transport session keys are ephemeral and distinct from wallet spending keys, requester identity keys, and worker payment keys.

Reconnect/resume may preserve the logical ComputeSession while deriving fresh traffic keys, subject to the session's normal expiry/eligibility bounds.
