# NIAHCIA Native Execution V1

Status: consensus format under implementation

## Scope

Native Execution V1 defines deterministic execution commitments for ordered
NIAHCIA native transactions.

The block header remains unchanged. Its `transactions_root` commits to the
ordered canonical signed native transactions. Its `execution_root` commits to
the deterministic result of executing those transactions.

## Transfer gas

A successful native Transfer V1 consumes exactly 1,000 gas.

A transaction may authorize a larger `gas_limit`, but unused gas capacity is
not charged.

## Fee calculation

For each transaction:

    max_execution_charge =
        gas_limit * max_fee_per_gas

    required_balance =
        value + max_execution_charge

The sender MUST have at least `required_balance` before execution.

The transaction is invalid when:

    max_fee_per_gas < base_fee_per_gas

Priority fee per gas is:

    min(
        max_priority_fee_per_gas,
        max_fee_per_gas - base_fee_per_gas
    )

Effective fee per gas is:

    base_fee_per_gas + priority_fee_per_gas

For a successful transaction:

    base_fee_burned =
        gas_used * base_fee_per_gas

    producer_priority_fee =
        gas_used * priority_fee_per_gas

    actual_fee =
        base_fee_burned + producer_priority_fee

    unused_fee_reserve =
        max_execution_charge - actual_fee

The base fee is burned.

The priority fee is transferred to the canonical CPU-PoW block producer and
does not create new supply.

## NativeReceiptV1

A successful transaction produces one receipt.

Fields, in commitment order:

1. transaction_id: 32 bytes
2. gas_used: unsigned 64-bit integer
3. effective_fee_per_gas: unsigned 128-bit integer
4. base_fee_burned: unsigned 128-bit integer
5. producer_priority_fee: unsigned 128-bit integer

Integer fields are encoded unsigned big-endian at their exact widths.

The receipt commitment is:

    Keccak256(
        "NIAHCIA/NATIVE-RECEIPT/V1" ||
        transaction_id ||
        gas_used_u64_be ||
        effective_fee_per_gas_u128_be ||
        base_fee_burned_u128_be ||
        producer_priority_fee_u128_be
    )

## Receipts root

For a non-empty ordered receipt list:

    receipts_root =
        Keccak256(
            "NIAHCIA/NATIVE-RECEIPTS-ROOT/V1" ||
            receipt_commitment_0 ||
            receipt_commitment_1 ||
            ...
        )

Receipt ordering is consensus-significant.

For an empty receipt list:

    receipts_root =
        Keccak256(
            "NIAHCIA/NATIVE-RECEIPTS-ROOT/V1/EMPTY"
        )

## Native execution root

The execution root commits to:

1. transactions_root: 32 bytes
2. resulting state_root: 32 bytes
3. receipts_root: 32 bytes
4. total gas_used: unsigned 64-bit integer
5. total base_fee_burned: unsigned 128-bit integer
6. total producer_priority_fee: unsigned 128-bit integer

Integer fields are unsigned big-endian at their exact widths.

The execution root is:

    Keccak256(
        "NIAHCIA/NATIVE-EXECUTION-ROOT/V1" ||
        transactions_root ||
        state_root ||
        receipts_root ||
        gas_used_u64_be ||
        base_fee_burned_u128_be ||
        producer_priority_fee_u128_be
    )

## Block execution

Transactions execute strictly in their canonical block order.

All transaction state transitions and aggregate accounting are checked.

Block execution is atomic.

If any transaction fails, or any aggregate arithmetic operation fails, the
entire block transition fails and canonical native state MUST remain exactly
as it was before block execution began.

A successful block result contains:

- transactions_root
- resulting state_root
- receipts_root
- execution_root
- aggregate gas_used
- aggregate base_fee_burned
- aggregate producer_priority_fee
- ordered transaction receipts

## Canonical persistence and independent validation

A persisted native block execution result MUST retain the complete canonical `NativeBlockExecutionResultV1`, including its ordered receipts and aggregate accounting fields. A node MUST NOT replace this data with an external execution hash, replay-journal pointer, or summary that cannot reproduce the committed execution result.

Canonical block persistence binds, atomically:

- `BlockHeaderV1`;
- the complete canonical native execution result;
- the resulting `NativeStateV1` snapshot;
- cumulative chain work and canonical-head selection.

If any commitment check or persistence step fails, none of those state changes may become visible as a committed native block transition.

A receiving peer MUST independently validate the block transition from locally trusted parent state and protocol data. Peer-supplied state snapshots are not authoritative.

## Empty blocks

An empty block:

- executes no transactions,
- consumes zero gas,
- burns zero base fee,
- pays zero transaction priority fees,
- preserves native account state,
- uses the canonical empty transaction root,
- uses the canonical empty receipts root,
- and still produces a deterministic execution root.

## Unsupported actions

Native Execution V1 currently implements Transfer execution.

ContractCall and ContractCreate MUST NOT be silently interpreted as Transfer
or accepted without their applicable native contract execution rules.

## Interoperability vector

This vector is consensus-locked by the native execution test suite.

## Native State V2 boundary

Native Execution V1 currently commits the accounts-only NativeStateV1 root.

Compute-channel consensus state is not silently added to NativeStateV1.

`spec/native-state-v2-compute-channels.md` defines the candidate explicit successor state format and activation boundary required before NativeTransaction V2 compute actions may execute.

Existing Native Execution V1 vectors remain unchanged.
