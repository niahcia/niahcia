# Capability

## Purpose

`Capability` is the permission primitive for tools, contracts, agents, storage, wallets, and other external actions.

Agents receive explicit capabilities rather than unrestricted ambient authority.

## Canonical fields

```text
Capability
- schema_version
- capability_id
- subject
- resource_type
- resource_identifier
- actions[]
- limits
- max_spend
- rate_limit
- valid_from
- expiry
- approval_mode
- delegate_allowed
- revocation_ref
- capability_hash
```

## Resource classes

Examples:

```text
WEB
STORAGE
BLOCKCHAIN
CONTRACT
WALLET
AGENT
COMPUTE
CUSTOM
```

## Actions

Examples include:

```text
READ
WRITE
INVOKE
EXECUTE
SPEND
SIGN_REQUEST
STORE
DELETE
```

Exact action vocabulary is resource-specific and versioned.

## Approval modes

```text
AUTO
USER_APPROVAL
CONTROLLER_APPROVAL
CONTRACT_POLICY
DENY
```

## Spending

An LLM or worker MUST NOT receive raw wallet private keys merely because an agent has spending authority.

Signing SHOULD be isolated in a component that validates Capability constraints before authorizing a transaction.

## Delegation

If `delegate_allowed` is false, child agents/tools cannot inherit the capability.

Delegated capabilities MUST be equal to or narrower than their parent authority.

## Invariants

1. Capabilities are deny-by-default.
2. Delegation cannot increase authority.
3. Spending and write capabilities MUST have explicit limits or policy references.
4. Expired/revoked capabilities are invalid even if cached by a worker.
5. Tool execution is sandboxed independently from permission authorization.

## first implementation milestone

first implementation milestone may use no tools or read-only capabilities, but the full capability model is part of Protocol v1.


## Specialized compute-payment authorization

Capability remains the general permission primitive. AI compute spending may additionally use `PaymentAuthorizationV1` for channel-aware hard monetary limits.

A Capability may authorize a subject to invoke compute, while PaymentAuthorizationV1 constrains the amount and scope that subject may spend.

Possessing one does not imply possession of the other, and neither exposes the wallet root private key.
